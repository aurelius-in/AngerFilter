# Project Plan: Anger Filter App (Powered by GPT)

## Introduction
The Anger Filter app is a mobile application powered by GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology, designed to help users communicate effectively even when they are angry. The app offers alternative message suggestions generated by GPT to help users get their point across in a non-offensive way, increasing the likelihood of a positive and cooperative response from the person they are communicating with.

## Objectives
The primary objective of the Anger Filter app is to improve users' communication skills and reduce conflict in both personal and professional settings using GPT-generated responses. Ongoing user feedback will be incorporated into the app to constantly improve the generated responses and inform future updates and psychological research.

## Features
1. **Alternative Message Suggestions**: When a user types or speaks an angry message into the app, the Anger Filter provides three alternative message suggestions generated by GPT to help the user communicate in a non-offensive way. These suggestions include a professional option, a casual friendly option, and a loving kind option.
2. **Customizable Settings**: Users can customize the app's settings to provide alternative message suggestions that are tailored to their specific communication style and relationships.
3. **Speech-to-Text Functionality**: Users can speak their angry message into the app, and the app will convert it into text for the alternative message suggestions.
4. **Security and Privacy**: The app will use state-of-the-art security and privacy features to ensure that user data is protected at all times.

## Technical Requirements
1. Anger Filter will be available for both iOS and Android platforms.
2. The app will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms powered by GPT to provide customized alternative message suggestions.
3. The app will use speech-to-text technology to convert spoken messages into text.
4. The app will require a server to store user data and manage app functionality.

## Target Market
The Anger Filter app is targeted towards individuals who struggle with anger management and communication, including couples, professionals, and individuals seeking to improve their communication skills.

## Ongoing User Feedback
Ongoing user feedback will be incorporated into the app to constantly improve the generated responses and inform future updates and psychological research. The app will collect user feedback and usage data, which will be analyzed to improve the effectiveness of the GPT-generated responses.
